# DonkeyDistort Distortion VST


### Features:
- Drive slider (mix)
- Chaos slider (random point between mix position and original position)
- Chaos Pause button (pauses the noise so that it is a static waveform)
- Wavetable slider (transforms between one randomized signal to another, emulating a wavetable)
- Resolution (how defined the randomization is)
- Seed slider (re initializes the wavetable array with new seed)

### Future Development:
- Image drag and drop to re-initialize wavetable array
- UI Cleanup
- Gain control
